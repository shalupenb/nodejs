  <strong>Types of Cars</strong>: A Complete Guide The world of automobiles is
  vast and diverse. From small city cars to massive SUVs, everyone can find a
  car to suit their taste and needs. Let's delve into the main types of cars and
  their features. Classification by Body Type One of the most common ways to
  classify cars is by body type. Each body type has its own advantages and
  disadvantages and is designed for specific purposes. <strong>Sedan</strong>: A
  classic option with a clear division into the engine compartment, passenger
  compartment, and trunk. It is distinguished by its comfort and spaciousness.
  Hatchback: A five-door car with a combined luggage compartment and passenger
  compartment. Compact and versatile. <strong>Station Wagon</strong>: Similar to
  a hatchback, but with a more spacious trunk. Ideal for families and
  transporting goods. <strong>Coupe</strong>: A two-door car with a dynamic
  design, often with a sporty character. Convertible: A two-door car with an
  open roof for summer trips. SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle): A car with high
  ground clearance and all-wheel drive, designed for off-road driving.
  <strong>Crossover</strong>: A compromise between a car and an SUV, combining
  comfort and off-road capability. <strong>Minivan</strong>: A spacious car with
  a high roof, designed to carry a large number of passengers.
  <strong>Pickup Truck</strong>: A truck with an open cargo bed in the rear.

  Front-wheel drive: The most common type of drive, especially for passenger
  cars. Rear-wheel drive: Often found on sports cars and some SUVs. Provides
  better handling but can be less stable on slippery roads. All-wheel drive:
  Provides maximum traction and grip on the road. Used on SUVs and some
  crossovers. Classification by Fuel Type Gasoline: The most common type of
  engine. Diesel: Fuel-efficient but less environmentally friendly than
  gasoline. Hybrid: Combines a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Electric:
  Runs exclusively on electricity.
